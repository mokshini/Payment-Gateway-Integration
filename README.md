# Payment-Gateway-Integration
This is a simple project that demonstrates payment gateway integration into a HTML/CSS based webpage. (only test mode enabled)

- The webpage is designed using HTML and CSS. The payment integration is done using razorpay

- First the user has to create an account on the razorpay website and then navigate to the dashboard, I have done this project under test mode

- Next navigate to the "add payment button" option on the dashboard and choose the required settings, fields , colors etc for your button to fulfill your needs.

- Once that's done, you will be redirected to a page where you can find the custom code genreated to add the button in your html file and hence the button will be displayed on the required webpage.

- Thus the payment gateway integration is complete.
